Kirby-like platformer game
**CONCEPT**
  -player is a student trying to make his/her way through college
  -enemies can include homework, supplies, bills, fees, and etc
  -mini bosses will include projects, mid-terms and finals
  -final boss will be a thesis paper or something
  
**MECHANICS**
  -will include occasional power-ups in the form of friends that tag along (this may be difficult to implement as its
   essentially a CPU, but we can take on this challenge if we want)
  -player will likely have some way of attacking enemies (maybe letter grades, and as we upgrade the weapon, the weapon
   shoots better grades (more damage)), we can modify this idea later
  -players will have to collect pieces of their diploma throughout the game. if at the end they do not have all the pieces,
   they lose
  -pop up window to show players their progress (diploma fragments collected, controls help, exit to title screen, etc)
  
**GRAPHICS**
  -we can probably hand draw some of this stuff and scan it into Unity

**WHAT DO PLAYERS LEARN FROM THIS**
  -we want to convey the struggles of being a college student
  -some parts of the game will be slightly exaggerated, but for the most part will simulate some real-life issues in college
